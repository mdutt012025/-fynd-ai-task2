Task1-: Rating Prediction via Prompt Engineering
The objective of Task 1 is to predict Yelp review star ratings (1–5) using prompt engineering with Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of traditional supervised classifiers.
The system must return predictions in a strict JSON format, along with a short explanation for the assigned rating.
